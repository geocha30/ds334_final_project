# This project, "Classifier for Under-Developed Countries in the World Using Neural Networks," focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to classify underdeveloped countries based on socio-economic indicators sourced from The World Bank Data Repository. We employ logistic regression and neural network models to predict a country's development status, addressing the challenge of data availability for underdeveloped regions and stressing the need for more data regarding underdeveloped countries.
